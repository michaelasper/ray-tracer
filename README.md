## Completed Features

* (10 pts) Triangle-Ray Intersection
* (10 pts) Phong Interpolation of Normals
* (20 pts) Basic Anti-aliasing
* (30 pts) Phong shading 

## "Completed" Features

* (10 pts) Light attenuation and shadow attenuation
* (10 pts) Reflection term
* (10 pts) Refraction term

In my opinion, these are I would say completed but there is a slight bug on them since we are very close to passing a few scenes and it's hard to pinpoint. When comparing towards the reference solution, it's very hard to tell a difference basically.
