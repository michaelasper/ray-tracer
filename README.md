### Adaptive Termination

Use `-z [threshold]`

### Stocahstic supersampling

Use `-f [samples]`

### Geometry supersampling

We have scenes in the quadrics/torus folders

### Depth of field

Use `-q [focalDistance] [aperatureSize]`

### 3D Images

Use `-d [3dmode]`

#### 3D modes:

0. Gray scale
1. Optimized half color

### Toon shading

Use `-n`
